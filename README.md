# HW5Scheduler
Daily Workday Planner

**Assignment Objective:**

Using a combination of HTML, CSS and javascript this task is meant to present a user with an interactive daily planner. The user is presented with a daily calendar with working hours between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., with the current date and time at the top. Using colors to note past/present/future tasks/activities, the task can be entered at the appropriate hour and the time slot will update based on the hour. The data will be saved in local storage so on browser refresh, each time slot will maintain the activity/task.


**Acceptance Criteria**

- GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner
- THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down
- THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a time block
- THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that time block
- THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page
- THEN the saved events persist
